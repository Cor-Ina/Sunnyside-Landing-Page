## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: https://corina-murg-sunnyside-landing-page.netlify.app/

## My process

### Built with
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Canva, a11y


### What I learned
Researched how to include multiple versions of the same picture, and used the "picture" element for the first time

Researched ways to add different hover stules and used the content property for the first time to 
style the sidebar menu

Learned how to change the color of a svg when hovered

### Continued development
Improve my approach on responsive design. Specifically, for my next project I will start with a mobile-first layout, so my CSS code is simpler

### Useful resources
Adaptive Design by Aaaron Gustafson
