## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: https://corina-murg-sunnyside-landing-page.netlify.app/

## My process
HTML work: divided the page into several sections: 
- header (with navbar, image and h1 title)
- main, with the following Sections: About, Services, Projects, Testimonials, and Gallery
- footer, with menu links and social media icons, plus attribution section 

Assigned alt text to important images.

Made sure the HTML is well-structured and organized, with appropriate tags and attributes.


CSS
Defined the styles for each element on the page, such as fonts, colors, margins, padding, and borders. 
Made sure the HTML elements had the appropriate IDs, Classes, or attributes.

Used flexbox to style the layout of the landing page.

Made sure the page was responsive and looks good on different screen sizes.

Optimized the HTML and CSS code by removing any unnecessary elements or styles. 

JavaScript
Used to display the sidebar on smaller screen sizes

ACCESSIBILITY
Used semantic HTML to make it easier for search engines and screen readers to understand the content of the page.

Researched about/included Skip-to-content button

### Built with
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Canva

### What I learned
Researched how to include multiple versions of the same picture, and used the "picture" element for the first time

Researched ways to add different styles of hover effect and used the content property for the first time to 
style the sidebar menu

Learned how to change the color of a svg when hovered

### Continued development
Improve my approach on responsive design. Specifically, for my next project I will start with a mobile-first layout, so my CSS code is simpler
